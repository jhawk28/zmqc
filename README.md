zmqc
====

my go port of the https://github.com/zacharyvoase/zmqc

I wanted a simple cat style utility that was easier to install (no runtime dependencies other than zeromq). It mostly functions the same as the python zmqc, but I simplified the flags and do not support the generic socket options.

Testing compile on Windows and OSX.
